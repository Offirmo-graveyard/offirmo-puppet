My puppet config
================

This is my puppet config. I use it to setup :
- Web servers (with email capabilities)
  - PHP/MySQL
  - wordpress
  - Wt
- C++ dev machines

The targeted machines are Ubuntu on Amazon web servers or virtualized (VMware / VirtualBox)

I make it public so other puppet users may have a look.
